# React Native Chart Kit Documentation

## Import components

This package is forked from https://github.com/indiespirit/react-native-chart-kit. I've added the pressable bar graph functionality.

1. `yarn add react-native-chart-kit-with-pressable-bar-graph`
   Just use this for the bar graph.

We'll have the onDataPointClick - which will give us the x - will be the starting point , y - will be the starting point , index and value of the bar graph.

So, we can use those values.

Then we can use the decorator, which can be React Component within the graph.

Here's a good article on how we can use both of these functions together -

After that, do these steps - and use it for other charts.

1. `yarn add react-native-chart-kit`
2. `yarn add react-native-svg` install peer dependencies
3. Use with ES6 syntax to import components
